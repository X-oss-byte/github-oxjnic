SolidJS and its use of Signals have been shaking up the frontend world the past year, but it spent its first few years of existence as a relatively unknown project only worked on by a few maintainers. Its story is not one of overnight success but years of small steps until one day we woke up to a world where almost every JavaScript framework had taken inspiration in Signals or found a renewed interest in fine-grained reactivity.

Getting to this point was not easy. Not only have we borrowed a lot from our inspirations, but relied on the generosity of our community of contributors and benefactors. Companies like Netlify, JetBrains, Builder.io, and many others have supported the development, feeding into programs like our [Fellowships](https://www.solidjs.com/blog/solid-fellowships-announcement), [SolidHack](https://hack.solidjs.com/) and now our [SolidStart Fund](https://opencollective.com/solid/projects/solidstart-fund). These programs and initiatives are carefully structured to feed value back to the community by directly supporting part-time resources and empowering our members with the opportunity to work on Solid.

So we are very happy to announce that the Chrome team through [Aurora](http://developer.chrome.com/aurora) will be contributing $30,000 towards our continued performance research. Aurora funds improvements to Core Web Vitals in open source frameworks.

This started back in the fall when [Addy Osmani](https://twitter.com/addyosmani) from the Chrome team encouraged us to create a Solid version of the [Taste Movies App](https://tastejs.com/movies/). We used this as an opportunity to enlist the community to try the latest experimental technology we had been working on, and the result exceeded even our expectations. They had built a full client-navigated server-rendered app that scored top marks in Lighthouse page metrics and had 1/10th the JavaScript payload of the most popular solutions.

</center>

We accomplish this using a technique of nested routed server-rendered HTML partials combined with partial hydrated "Islands". Combining the small JavaScript delivery of Islands with the state preservation found in single page applications.

It's one thing to prototype new exciting technology. It is a whole other to support its general adoption. There are still [performance improvements to be made, techniques to be applied, and rough edges to smooth out](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-start/issues/400). This contribution will give us the means to not only build out this technology but explore some of the less understood overheads in JavaScript frameworks like the cost of hydration and serialization.

We aim to approach this project the way we have approached SolidJS since the beginning; based on the numbers, with [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/learn-core-web-vitals/) setting the guidelines. We are particularly interested in ensuring great INP(Interaction to Next Paint) scores while maintaining low LCP(Largest Contentful Paints) and TBT (Total Blocking Time).

This is an exciting time for open-source software and SolidJS. The SolidJS Team is honored to have been granted this incredible opportunity to continue our research and development, exploring new avenues and ideas that will unlock incredible performance and DX. We look forward to working closely with the Chrome team in building a faster web.
