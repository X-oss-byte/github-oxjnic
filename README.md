# Solid Website

This is the source code for the solid website: [https://solidjs.com/](https://solidjs.com/)

## Getting started

The website is built with [Solid](https://github.com/solidjs/solid). In order to get going, you should be familiar with the core API of Solid and how it works on the surface.

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/solidjs/solid-site?title=SolidJS)

### Prerequisites

- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

### Install

1. Clone the project locally: `git clone https://github.com/solidjs/solid-site`
2. Change directory into your local copy: `cd solid-site`
3. Install the dependencies: `pnpm i`

### Available commands

- `pnpm i`: Install the dependencies
- `pnpm dev`: Start the dev server
- `pnpm build`: Build the project
- `pnpm build:sitemap`: Generate the `sitemap.xml` file
- `pnpm format`: Format the whole project with prettier
- `pnpm deploy:dev`: Helper method to deploy to dev
- `pnpm deploy:prod`: Helper method to deploy to prod

### PWA Testing

Solid Site supports PWA and worker auto updating powered by Vite PWA Plugin. When testing `run pnpm https-preview`. Running it the first time will ask to install the certificate if not yet done. Then open your Chrome and press <kbd>F12</kbd> > Network Tab > browse to https://localhost. Wait until the network requests with gears at the begining stops downloading the SW precache, then on the same Network Tab just change `No throttling` option to `Offline`. All pages should work by pressing <kbd>F5</kbd> (do not do a hard refresh <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd> as it will force the browser to go to the server and the Chrome Dinosaur will appear).

## Additional information

#### How do the documentation files work?

They're imported from the [Solid Docs](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-docs) package. There's a script there that builds the markdown files into consumable JSON files, and the package provides functions to load them.
